1.) Any time event fires on user side, "ingest" event.
 - parse pieces of event that need to be saved in DB (json object)
- store in local storage cache on front end

2.) Create interval loop that consumes cache
- are we current writing to db?
 - if not, grab next cached item and write to db
- if writingToDb = true, prevent new writing to db until complete

3.) Function that writes to db
- every time it's called it writes to db from cache

4.) Loading data from db

5.) write function that synthesizes user actions (draw on everyone's canvas 
simultaneously)
