# Guess My Draw

## Like Pictionary? It’s like that, only you don’t need to wear pants.

### **Concept**-   This is a simple game where one player tries to draw a picture, and the rest of the players try to guess what they’re drawing.
    
-   Games like this are fun to play with a group.
-   User story:
As a person playing the game, I want to be able to draw a picture and have my friends guess what I’m drawing. If someone guesses correctly, I want the game to pick a new person to draw and start over.

## **Process**
-   Technologies used: Node.js, sequelize, express-session, bcrypt, socket.io
    
-   Challenges: socket.io is a technology we didn’t learn in the bootcamp.
    
-   Successes: Figuring out how socket.io worked wasn’t as hard as expected.

# **Directions for Future Development**
-   Mobile version - Making a canvas element that you can draw on be responsive turns out to be very complicated.
    
-   Add ability to tell if a game is already running before you arrive
    
-   Add rooms
    
-   Modularize code
